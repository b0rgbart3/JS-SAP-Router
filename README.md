  *  This is a Javascript based router that allows you to build a "Single Page App"
  *  Using just a little Javascript and a little PHP.  The Navigation Links are
  *  built dynamically from an array using PHP.  The links are responded to in 
  *  javascript, using JQuery -- and then an AJAX request is sent to the server
  *  to load in the corresponding HTML page.  We use JQuery again to update
  *  the DOM.
